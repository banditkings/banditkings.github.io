Create a file for your custom scripts","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\n\nAt work or grad school, I have to juggle a lot of projects and it always takes me a while to remember which directory I was in and what I named the project environment. I wanted 'shortcuts' in the terminal that would automate the things I was typing out manually each time. To do this, I saved these custom functions and `source` them into `.zshrc`.\n\n\nI store a file for these personal macros, let's create one here:\n\n```bash\ncd /usr/local/bin/\ntouch personal_macros.\nvi personal_macros\n```\n\nThis navigates to your `/usr/local/bin/` directory, creates the `personal_macros` file with `touch` and uses vim to open it with `vi`.\n\n## 2. Write functions\n\nOnce your blank file is created you need to add in your functions. The first line that starts with the `#!` (shebang) tells bash that this is a zshell script. I don't remember if this is absolutely necessary but I had it here.\n\n```bash\n#!/usr/bin/env zsh\n\nfunction explore() {\n  cd ~/Documents/Analysis\n  conda activate explore\n  code .\n}\n\nfunction workmode() {\n  cd ~/Documents/Analysis/GT/ISYE6501\n  open .\n  open ISYE6501.Rproj\n}\n```\n\nThese are examples of basic functions. The first one, `explore()` navigates to a folder and activates a conda environment called `explore`. Then it opens up a vscode window in the folder.\n\nThe second function `workmode()` navigates to another folder, opens an explorer window there, and then will open my `ISYE6501.Rproj` project in RStudio.\n\nRemember, when you're done with vim, type `:wq` to save your changes and exit.\n\n```vim\n:wq\n```\n\n## 3. Add these functions to your `.zshrc` file\n\nAfter you're done creating the functions it's time to add them to the `.zshrc` file so you can call these functions from the terminal.\n\n```console\ncd\nvi .zshrc\n```\n\nThen you want to add a line to `source` your `personal_macros` file by adding in this line to the `.zshrc` file:\n\n```bash\nsource /usr/local/bin/personal_macros\n```\n\nGo ahead and save and exit vim:\n\n```vim\n:wq\n```\n\nNow you can reload your terminal and the functions will be available to you! Just type `explore` or `workmode` and it'll run through the steps in your script.\n\nI like to create functions that follow a particular taxonomy. For work projects, I'll make a function for each project I'm working on, starting with `work-` so it's easy to remember and I can utilize tab completion. For example, I'll have a `work-unicorn` function when I'm working on the unicorn project and a `work-phoenix` function when I want to resume work on the phoenix project.\n\nHappy scripting!\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\nAt work or grad school, I have to juggle a lot of projects and it always takes me a while to remember which directory I was in and what I named the project environment.
