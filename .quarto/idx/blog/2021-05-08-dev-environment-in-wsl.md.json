You can query these models through python with a little work on a Windows PC but I couldn't get all of the dependencies to work on my Mac.\n\nSo here we are. I'm saving this as my checklist of making a decent dev environment using WSL2 where I can do a lot of my ad-hoc analysis in Python/Julia.\n\nHere are my requirements:\n\n- I primarily do data analysis in Python using Jupyter Notebooks and VSCode\n- I need to be able to write Markdown docs and preview LaTEX in Markdown\n- I need an installation of Julia for side projects and light data work, primarily in Jupyter Notebooks or via the REPL\n\n\nFollow the [official docs from Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) to enable WSL2 and install a Linux distribution.
