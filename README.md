# My old github site

Previous version of my static site using Hugo, I've since transitioned over to NextJS and Vercel, so this gets to go into the Archive.

## Custom CSS

Followed instructions for custom CSS and downloaded the table class from bootstrap 4 in order to get tables to look better. But, dark mode sucks with it

### Tables

* [Adding CSS to Markdown Tables](https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/how-to-customise-tables/15661/6)
  * Fixes issue with [this blog post](https://zwbetz.com/style-a-markdown-table-with-bootstrap-classes-in-hugo/)

## Theme

This site uses the Anatole theme with some custom CSS added.
