I'm an analyst. I love learning new ways to work faster and make work more fun! I use this site to keep some notes that you might find useful.

### Why 

The name of this website is based on an old game called Bandit Kings of Ancient China, which in turn was based on an old chinese novel.

### Why Data Science?

I'm fascinated with using data science as a way *to facilitate the best possible decision making*. I'm obsessed with it because I didn't make the best decisions when it mattered.

Over a decade ago, I was leading convoys within the capital city of Afghanistan during one of the deadliest years of the war. All throughout the city there were threats - bad guys who were looking to do us harm and to the innocent people around us. As a convoy commander, I needed to plan out which routes to take to get the team from point A to point B (and back safely) while avoiding the bad guys.

So many years later I asked myself: 

> Am I a good decision maker?

I survived, but a lot of people didn't. And everyone under my command survived, and a lot of people didn't. Those people who had *decades* of more experience than I did who lost their lives - were they bad decision-makers?

After looking back and pondering this question, I realized that I was **not** a good decision-maker. A good decision should incorporate probabilistic thinking, and instead I ultimately operated primarily through instinct and intuition. Even worse, I vastly under or over-estimated probabilities of events occurring, and it was a tremendous mental burden to carry - one that took years to undo.

I'm now on a journey to answer the question:

> What advice or strategy I could give to that younger me to make the better decisions?

I'm capturing what I learn here, and a few other tips and tricks along the way.
