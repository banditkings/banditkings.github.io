### Why Am I Writing About This Stuff?

I'm fascinated with using data science as a way *to facilitate the best possible decision making*. I'm obsessed with it because I didn't make the best decisions when it mattered.

Over a decade ago, I was leading convoys within the capital city of Afghanistan during one of the deadliest years of the war. All throughout the city there were threats - bad guys who were looking to do us harm and to the innocent people around us. As a convoy commander, I needed to plan out which routes to take to get the team from point A to point B (and back safely) while avoiding the bad guys.

So many years later I asked myself:

> Am I a good decision maker?

I survived, but a lot of people didn't. And everyone under my command survived, and a lot of people didn't. Those people who had *decades* of more experience than I did who lost their lives - were they bad decision-makers?

After looking back and pondering this question, I realized that I was **not** a good decision-maker. A good decision should incorporate probabilistic thinking, and instead I ultimately operated primarily through instinct and intuition. Even worse, I vastly under or over-estimated probabilities of events occurring, and it was a tremendous mental burden to carry - one that took years to undo.

I'm now on a journey to answer the question:

> What advice or strategy I could give to that younger me to make the better decisions?

That's why I'm obsessed with the parts of data science that help me understand the world better and help me build tools to facilitate better decisions. I'm capturing what I learn here, and a few other tips and tricks along the way.

### Why Bandit Kings?

The name of this website is based on an old Koei historical simulation game called [Bandit Kings of Ancient China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandit_Kings_of_Ancient_China), which in turn was based on [The Water Margin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_Margin), the same book that inspired the amazing [Suikoden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suikoden) series.
