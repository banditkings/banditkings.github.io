Dash applications need a lot of work to make them look good. Here's a few 'how to' extras that can help out

## Latex in Markdown

The latest release of Dash made it *much* easier to add Latex to your markdown elements. Here's an example:

```python
dcc.Markdown(children="""
This is Latex:
$$
\\begin{align}
y &= x \\\\ 
&= 0
\\end{align}
$$
""", mathjax=True)
```
Which gives us:

There were only two tricky bits now: you must set the `mathjax=True` in order to enable it, and you need to add an extra backslash (i.e. \ becomes \\\\). 

This is just an artifact of how it's rendering escape characters.

## Add Custom Google Fonts

You can use CSS for everything in your Dash app except for the charts that Plotly generates. So, adding in Google fonts is relatively straightforward - you can either follow the @import instructions add a new css file to your /assets/ folder or you can add it in as an external stylesheet.

1. Load it in to assets:

```python
# \assets\fonts.css
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Press+Start+2P&display=swap');

body {
    font-family: 'Press Start 2P';
}
```

2. Add it as an external stylesheet

```python
from dash import Dash, html

external_stylesheets = [
    "https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Press+Start+2P&display=swap"
]

app = Dash(__name__, external_stylesheets=external_stylesheets)

app.layout = html.Div([
    # Title
    html.H1(children="Dashboard Title", id="db-name", 
            style={"font-family": "'Press Start 2P'"}),
])

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run_server(debug=True)
```
