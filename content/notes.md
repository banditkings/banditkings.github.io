# Notes

Links to Jupyter Notebooks rendered in HTML and available through [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.org) to review key concepts. I don't work in Julia every day so I find it useful to keep a record of basic syntax until this becomes muscle memory.

## Julia

* Basic Julia DataFrame loading and manipulation, i.e. Subsetting Rows in a DataFrame, pulling a CSV from the web, PyCall [ipynb](https://github.com/banditkings/julia-examples/blob/main/Data%20Munging/Julia%20By%20Example.ipynb) [html](https://nbviewer.org/github/banditkings/julia-examples/blob/main/Data%20Munging/Julia%20By%20Example.ipynb)
* Linear Regression with GLM [ipynb](https://github.com/banditkings/julia-examples/blob/main/Modeling/Linear%20Regression%20with%20Julia.ipynb) [html](https://nbviewer.org/github/banditkings/julia-examples/blob/main/Modeling/Linear%20Regression%20with%20Julia.ipynb)
* A Julia Project Workflow, i.e. setting up a new environment and project scaffolding [ipynb](https://github.com/banditkings/julia-examples/blob/main/Workflow/A%20Julia%20Workflow.ipynb) [html](https://nbviewer.org/github/banditkings/julia-examples/blob/main/Workflow/A%20Julia%20Workflow.ipynb)
